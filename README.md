# Autumn

## What is it?

Autumn is an application framework and a template, using lwjgl (opengl, glfw)<br>
build with java 1.8

I want it to be simple to make an application with intractable stuff in it.

You can customize and implement anything.

##### Only supports windows (for now)

## How to use it

**Without a Java IDE**

Open the root directory, and in Project/src you will find 2 folders.<br> One called Project and one called Autumn, Autumn folder is where the source code for Autumn is,<br>and the Project folder is where your Main file is

To compile you will go to scripts and run the Compile.bat file, and if all goes well you have an Autumn application!

**With a Java IDE**

Open the Project folder with the src folder inside.<br>Set the needed settings and run it, and if all goes well you have an Autumn application!

## Requirements

* [Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads#jdk19-windows) (Java 16+ is recommended)
